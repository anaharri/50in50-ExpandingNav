# 50 PROJECTS IN 50 DAYS | HTML, CSS & JS
Here is the third project of my 50in50 series, based on a Udemy course by Brad Traversy.   
  
  
### The task is to create simple, beautiful interfaces and widgets using only* HTML, CSS & JS.


For some of these, I just follow the tutorial exactly as it is, focused on sharpening those core concepts;  
but other times, I take the tutorial as a starting point, and from there on I work on making it my own - playing with different styles, adding details, sometimes even using extra tools (e.g. LESS or SASS).

Either way, my only goal is to have fun and create beautiful things, expanding my toolkit one line of code at a time.

*I had bought the course a while ago, when I was starting my journey in web development; however, as many of us do, I bought it along with several others, and I left it behind in hopes of finishing a more extensive one. Then I got into a coding bootcamp, learnt React, and never worked with pure CSS and JS again since*  

*But recently, I've been reconnecting with my passion for frontend development and design, and understanding, more than ever, the importance of mastering the basics; so I decided to pick CSS and vanilla JS back up, starting Brad's course over from scratch. And let me tell you, I had a lot of fun creating this project; it was fast and simple, and a great way to dust off all those core concepts. Since it was so strongly based on images, I took the liberty of turning it into a bit of a vision board for my life, or a collection of a few of my favorite things :)*  

*I'm actually looking forward to creating another one tomorrow.*  
*Stay tuned!*
